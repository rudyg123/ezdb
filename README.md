# ezdb: MySQL and PostgreSQL Database Tool
The ezdb application combines MySQL and PostgreSQL database management into one easy-to-use Linux command-line interface tool. It utilizes the Python ncurses library framework, npyscreen, and provides a form-based user interface for easily building powerful SQL queries; creating databases and tables; adding and deleting data; managing users and permissions; and providing complete query results with pagination. 

<h2> Architecture </h2>
The ezdb database tool is a Linux-based program written in Python. The backend implements two adapter frameworks for communicating with MySQL and postgreSQL database systems (MySQL Connector and pyscopg2). This lightweight command-line interface combines a facade and template architecture design. It also includes an ncurses-based frontend framework called npyscreen for the command-line user interface.

The general program flow is as follows:
<ul>
<li>	A user launches the ezdb tool implementing the npyscreen ncurses-based frontend</li>
<li>	Per user specification, the tool connects to a specified local or remote host</li>
<li>	The program uses one of two adapters to interface with the selected database management system (DBMS): psycopg2 for PostgreSQL or MySQL Connector for MySQL</li>
<li>	All database interactions specific to the DBMS are handled by ezdbâ€™s frontend and backend files</li>
<li>	The user can switch between PostgreSQL and MySQL at any time without have to exit the program</li>
</ul>
